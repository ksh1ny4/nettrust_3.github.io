        <p class="card-text">Cookies are temporary files that a website stores in your browser in order to remember your interactions on the site and improve your future visits. Thanks to cookies, sites can access information about your online activity.
            Whether you are browsing from a desktop computer, your cell phone, a standalone browser or an application, cookies allow sites to recognize users. The information that is shared is very valuable for improving online marketing.
            Cookies are usually used mainly for two main purposes: to remember access and browsing habits. Cookies allow web pages to identify your computer, and therefore, if you enter them again, they can remember who you are and what you have done before.
            These cookies are like surveillance cameras placed by these companies all over the Internet, so they can know what pages you enter, and therefore, create a profile of your personal tastes. They can also record your searches in search engines such as Google or Bing, or the internal ones of online stores, also to know your tastes and needs.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">WHAT ARE COOKIES USED FOR?</h5>
        <p class="card-text">The main functionality of cookies is to recognize users. By enabling them, a person can return to an online store and continue with the purchase left in the cart or keep an updated search history within the site. They also serve to store information that is typically requested on various registration or purchase forms (name, location, age, account numbers, etc.) and is necessary to learn user behaviors. This also makes it easier for other companies to display personalized advertising.
            If your website has cookies you will be able to:
            
            Save the purchase items in the cart until your customers manage to finalize the process.
            Remember the data of your visitors to avoid having to fill them every time they return.
            Record the preferences of people who interact with your site, for example: language, location or currency with which they prefer to pay.
            Cookies are also used to remember user behavior on a web page. For example, imagine that you have added several products to the shopping cart of an online store, but you have left the page without completing the purchase. Thanks to cookies, the online store will be able to remember the items you had in the cart and you will not have to add them again.
On the other hand, one of the most widespread uses of cookies is to know the browsing habits of users. This function is one of the most used in web marketing and advertising, for example, to show the user ads or content related to their interests..</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">HOW DO COOKIES WORK?</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Basically, when you access a page for the first time, a cookie is downloaded and stored in your browser. If you return, the site will look for a cookie with your name on it. By finding it, it will be able to facilitate navigation because it has recognized you, adapting the information that appears on your screen according to your previous interactions on the site.

            That is the reason why, when you perform a Google search that you had already done days before, you will see that the links you clicked on the first time appear in a different color. This allows you to distinguish the sites you had entered before from those where you did not..</p>
