        <p class="card-text">Cookies are temporary files that a website stores in your browser in order to remember your interactions on the site and improve your future visits. Thanks to cookies, sites can access information about your online activity.
            Whether you are browsing from a desktop computer, your cell phone, a standalone browser or an application, cookies allow sites to recognize users. The information that is shared is very valuable for improving online marketing..</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">WHAT ARE COOKIES USED FOR?</h5>
        <p class="card-text">The main functionality of cookies is to recognize users. By enabling them, a person can return to an online store and continue with the purchase left in the cart or keep an updated search history within the site. They also serve to store information that is typically requested on various registration or purchase forms (name, location, age, account numbers, etc.) and is necessary to learn user behaviors. This also makes it easier for other companies to display personalized advertising.
            If your website has cookies you will be able to:
            
            Save the purchase items in the cart until your customers manage to finalize the process.
            Remember the data of your visitors to avoid having to fill them every time they return.
            Record the preferences of people who interact with your site, for example: language, location or currency with which they prefer to pay..</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">HOW DO COOKIES WORK?</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Basically, when you access a page for the first time, a cookie is downloaded and stored in your browser. If you return, the site will look for a cookie with your name on it. By finding it, it will be able to facilitate navigation because it has recognized you, adapting the information that appears on your screen according to your previous interactions on the site.
            That is the reason why, when you perform a Google search that you had already done days before, you will see that the links you clicked on the first time appear in a different color. This allows you to distinguish the sites you had entered before from those where you did not..</p>
