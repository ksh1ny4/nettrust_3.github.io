        <p class="Mi-parrafo">Its essential to note that while most cookies are harmless and facilitate a smoother online experience, there are concerns about privacy and security. Some cookies can track users across different websites, potentially revealing sensitive information. As a result, privacy regulations and browser settings often allow users to control or block cookies to protect their online privacy. For the most part, accepting cookies on a website will not result in any catastrophic event. However, something to take into consideration and be wary of is when a website asks if you want your device to remember what your login credentials are for that website. While this would make logging into a website more convenient, it could potentially create a problem if you are reusing passwords or tend to create extremely easy passwords, as hackers could easily find that information in a data breach and your personal information could put you at risk. If you are disclosing private information on a website, and they ask if you want to accept the cookies policy, it is best to pass and decline. Because this personal information can be used to access accounts, so you should keep that information away from the data-mining websites.

    <p class="Mi-parrafo">Passwords are a critical defense against unauthorized access, but they are vulnerable when weak or predictable. To enhance security, use strong and unique passwords for each account, avoiding common words and incorporating a mix of characters. Additionally, consider adding extra layers of protection like two-factor authentication (2FA) and multi-factor authentication (MFA). A longer password (at least 12 characters) and complexity (mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols) are essential. Avoid common words, phrases, and patterns, and regularly update passwords for important accounts. 2FA and MFA further strengthen your digital security.</p>
    <p class="Mi-parrafo"><h4 class="Mi-parrafo">5 TIPS TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR INFORMATION </h4>
     1. Access through incognito mode to the web browser.<br class=>
        2. Delete cookies stored in browsers periodically.<br class=>
        3. Log out of all websites when you stop using them so that cookies expire.<br>
        4. Do not access from public wifi networks to websites that have critical information, such as homebanking.<br> 5. Have cybersecurity solutions such as antivirus, anti-malware, firewalls, among others.
